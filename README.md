# iCalWizard (macOS only)

A command line utility, based on iCalBuddy, to automatically schedule an event of a specified duration within a specified number of (future) days and priority.


It is my first step towards emulating what the (old) iPhone app Timeful was doing: an excellent integration between ToDos and Calendars.

For the moment there is no integration between Task Warrior (my ToDo app of choice) and iCalWizard.

Note: a text file (recent_emails.txt) is needed for fuzzy search of emails of event invitees.
